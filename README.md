# Air_quality_index_prediction_using_ML
In an era where urbanization and industrialization are rapidly
increasing, monitoring and predicting air quality has become crucial
for public health and environmental management. Machine learning
techniques have emerged as powerful tools in this endeavor. By
analyzing historical and real-time data from various sensors and
sources, machine learning models can learn complex patterns and
correlations in air quality parameters. These models can then predict
the Air Quality Index (AQI), providing valuable insights into the
potential levels of pollutants like particulate matter, ozone, sulfur
dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide. The existing system for air quality assessment often relies on
conventional monitoring methods, such as fixed-location air quality
monitoring stations. These stations collect data on various pollutants
at specific points, providing a limited spatial coverage of air quality
information. While these systems offer valuable insights, they might
not capture the fine-grained variations in air quality within a city or
region.The proposed system leverages advanced machine learning
techniques to overcome the limitations of the existing approach. By
integrating data from a variety of sources, including satellite imagery, weather forecasts, and crowd-sourced sensor data, the proposed
system aims to create a more comprehensive and accurate
representation
